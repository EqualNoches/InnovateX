# InnovateX

Welcome to **InnovateX**! This repository is my personal playground and learning space as I dive into the wonderful world of web development with the Django framework.

## üöÄ About This Project

InnovateX is born out of a desire to learn by doing. The primary goal is to build a functional web application from the ground up, exploring the core concepts and best practices of Django. While the end product will be a showcase of my skills, the journey of building it is the real treasure.

I'm using this project to document my progress, challenges, and discoveries. Feel free to follow along!

## üéØ Project Goal

The main objective is to create a simple, yet robust, web application that demonstrates proficiency in:

* Django's Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture
* User authentication and authorization
* Database setup and migrations
* Static file management (CSS, JavaScript, images)
* Form handling and validation

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Database:** SQLite (for development)
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## üèÅ Getting Started

As this is a work in progress, these instructions will evolve. For now, if you'd like to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/EqualNoches/InnovateX.git
    cd InnovateX
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    # For macOS/Linux
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # For Windows
    py -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
    *(A `requirements.txt` file will be added soon. For now, you'll need to install Django.)*

    ```bash
    pip install Django
    ```

4. **Run database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

The application will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` locally.

You can also see a preview running at `https://equalnoches.pythonanywhere.com/`.
